   1. Create Command class with: php artisan make:command NameClass

   2. Go to app/Console/Commands/ and find the class file NameClass.php

   3. In the NameClass.php you have two attributes $signature (the name of the command) and $description (Information about what your command does).

   4. Set the name and the description of your command.Ex: protected $signature='namecommand'; protected $descripton = 'This method migrate tables in order'

   5. Inside the NameClass.php you have a method called handle(), here you have to declare the code you want to be executed when you write the command.
   
   6. Register your command. Go to app/Console/Kernel.php and add your class to the list of Command Classes. protected $commands = [
    Commands\NameClass::class,
    ];
   
   7. Write the command in the terminal. php artisan namecommand

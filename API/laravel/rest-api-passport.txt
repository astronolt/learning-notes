CREATING API REST WITH LARAVEL 8 PASSPORT AUTHENTICATION
=========================

[1]
Install Passport via the Composer package manager:
 composer require laravel/passport

***
If installation fails
You can also try re-running composer require with an explicit version constraint, to figure out if any version is installable
 composer require laravel/passport:*
or if you know which you need.
 composer require laravel/passport:^2.1"



[2]
Migrate the new passport tables
 php artisan migrate

Then install a passport
 php artisan passport:install



[3]
configure the model, service provider, and auth config file.

In model, we added HasApiTokens class of Passport,
 use Laravel\Passport\HasApiTokens;

In auth.php, we added API auth configuration.
 'guards' => [
        'web' => [
            'driver' => 'session',
            'provider' => 'users',
        ],
        'api' => [
            'driver' => 'passport',
            'provider' => 'users',
        ],
    ],

CREATING API REST WITH LARAVEL 8 PASSPORT AUTHENTICATION
=========================

summary
Laravel provides an easy way to create API. if you have authentication in your mobile app then you can easily do it using a passport. Laravel 8 Passport provides a way to create auth token for validating users.




[1]
Install Passport via the Composer package manager:
 composer require laravel/passport

***
If installation fails
You can also try re-running composer require with an explicit version constraint, to figure out if any version is installable
 composer require laravel/passport:*
or if you know which you need.
 composer require laravel/passport:^2.1"



[2]
Migrate the new passport tables
 php artisan migrate

Then install a passport
 php artisan passport:install



[3]
configure the model, service provider, and auth config file.

In model, we added HasApiTokens class of Passport,
 use Laravel\Passport\HasApiTokens;

In auth.php, we added API auth configuration.
 'guards' => [
        'web' => [
            'driver' => 'session',
            'provider' => 'users',
        ],
        'api' => [
            'driver' => 'passport',
            'provider' => 'users',
        ],
    ],




[4]
Create a Products table and migrate.
 php artisan make:migration products
Create a name and details column in the Product's table.

Then also create a Products model
 php artisan make:model Product
Make the columns name and details fillable
 protected $fillable = [
    'name', 'detail'
];




[5]
Add new routes In the routes/api.php file


And create new controllers in app/controllers/API folder:
BaseController, ProductController, and RegisterController
